#### DEMO: 
* In-sample approximation of discontinuous function f with discontinuities arising from two sub-patterns: f_1 and f_2 defined on a partition of the input space.  NB the (feed-forward neural network) ffNN cannot capture the sub-pattern behaviour while the architope (tope) can.

## Requirements

To install requirements:
*  Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)  version 4.8.2.
* Create Conda Environment
``` pyhton
# cd into the same directory as this README file.

conda create python=3.8 --name architopes \
conda activate architopes \
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## Organization of directory:
 - Data in the "inputs" sub-directory,
 - All model outputs go to the "outputs" subdirectory,
 - Jupyternotebook versions of the python files and auxiliary "standalone python scripts" are found in the "Auxiliary_Codes" subdirectory.  

---

## Preprocessing, Training, and Evaluating
1. Specify the parameters related to each set and the space of hyper parameters in the "Grid_Enhanced_Network.py" script.   

2. Preprocessing data, train models and obtaining predictions can all be done by executing the following commands:
python3.8 Architope.py
python3.8 Architope_Expert.py
python3.8 Architope_Expert_Semi_Supervised_Standalone.py

The first trains the semi-supervised architope model and the following benchmark modelds: (Vanilla) ffNN, Grad.Bstd Rand.F, Bagged Architope, and Architope-logistic.  The subsequent two scripts, respectively, train the architope on the expert-provided partition described [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing) and architope obtained from an additional repartitioning step, as described by Algorithm 3.2 of the paper.

## Experimental Results

### 1) Tracking Portfolio of Day-Ahead Bitcoin Price
The trajectory of a typical cryptocurrency's price process is best modeled by a function with many jump discontinuities.  This makes predicting the day-ahead bitcoin's price based on the current day's returns of 15 *(other)* major cryptocurrencies's returns a natural testing ground for the architope.  Our result

### 2) California Housing Market
The [California Housing Price Dataset](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing) is a dataset where an expert provided partition of the input space, based on geo-special features, is exogenously known.  This makes this dataset a good candidate for comparing our training Algorithm's ability to infer a good partition to a known "good partition".  Our models and their benchmarks achieves the following performance on:


*NB:* The house prices were multiplied by $10^{-5}$ to avoid exploding gradient issues.

### 3) Synthesized Example
Our last example allows us to visually scrutinize the difference between the feed-forward architecture and the architope.  Specifically, we qualitatively and quantitatively examine our architecture's ability (and its training algorithm) to learn patterns with jump discontinuities.  We turn to a univariate illustration to streamline our visualization of this phenomenon.
